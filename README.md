# https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/years/2024_totals.html this is the link to the website to get all the variables and stats.
# The website Basketballreference has all the stats of players ranging from the NBA, WNBA, and even the G-League. You can get stats from all the teams and from any past seasons.
# For this project I used the data from the 2024 season. Then made a dataframe with the names of the players, the minutes they have played, and their three-point shooting percentage. 
#After that I found how many players there were.
#For the second question I created the graph of the distribution of the three-point shooting percentage made by all the players indiviually. I also described the graph using statistics.
#Lastly I made a graph showing the relationship between the time (minutes) played by each player and the three-point shooting percentage. I chose Caitlin Clark to highlight and labeled it with her name.
#Instructions
#I made the code run the website and got the information from the website and put it into R. I then created my variables I would be using.\
#Afterward I created a graph for the distribution of three point percentages, with the x axis labeled the percentages and the y axis labeled with the number of players. 
#Finally I created a graph comparing the relationship between minutes played and three point percentage using ggplot. I labeled the x axis with minutes played and y axis with the three point percentage.
